    <h1>OOP - Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p>Object - An instance of a class, each object has unique attributes and functions, object is like a cookie</p>
    <p>Class - Template to create similar objects, class is like a cookie cutter</p>
    <p>Constructor - Special method that initializes objects with no return type. Overloaded constructors give object unique attribute values</p>
    <p>Subclass - Class derived from another class, has an is-a relationship with superclass</p>
    <p>Superclass - Class that subclass is derived from. All Java Classes have are subclases of the Object class</p>
    <p>Public Keyword - Can be used when declaring methods and/or attributes, will be visible to any foreign entity. The class and constructor are always public, methods depend on their function</p>
    <p>Private Keyword - Can be used when declaring methods and/or attributes, can only be accessed in class. Attributes are mostly private, methods depend on their function</p>
    <p>This Keyword - Refers to current object in a method, makes code more readable and clearer when parameters have same name</p>
    <p>Get Methods - Methods that allow access to attributes which are generally private by returning them</p>
    <p>Set Methods - Methods that allow mutation to attributes which are generally private by overloading the method</p>
    <p>Inheritance - Defining a very general class, and then creating classes with more and more detail. Keyword extends indicates inheritance.</p>
    <p>Polymorphism - Occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance, subclass method is overriden even when object is of type superclass</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Constructors and Objects</h2>
    <img class="tut-img" src="images/oopConstructor.png" alt="image1">
    <p>REMEMBER!!</p>
    <p>1. A default constructor is always made in Java when there is none made by you, however you need to always assign your attributes default values</p>
    <p>2. Java is a case sensitive language, remember this when making methods, creating objects, and assigning values</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Inheritance and Polymorphism</h2>
    <img class="tut-img" src="images/oopPolymorphism.png" alt="image1">
    <img class="project-img" src="images/outputPoly.png" alt="image1">
    <p>REMEMBER!!</p>
    <p>1. You can only create subclass objects of superclass type, not vice versa, or subclass objects of separate subclass type.</p>
    <p>Dog myObj = new Animal(); and Pig myObj = new Dog(); will both cause an error</p>
    <p>2. Polymorphism only works when the method names are the same between the subclass and superclass. Otherwise, if a subclass object of superclass type calls a subclass method that doesn't share its name in one of the superclass methods, it will cause an error. To do so, it will need to casted as that subclass onject when calling the method.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Impact and My Understanding</h2>
    <p>The main benefits of OOP is that it is easy to hide and show information across other foreign platforms according to the authors wish (encapsulation), and most importantly, code reuse. This can be seen when using subclasses and superclasses, were in essence wee divide a big problem into smaller and smaller more specific chunks using code we already have. OOP is an easy to understand and changeable approach to coding, and many languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python use this approach as well.    </p>
    <br>
    <p>For me, it was important to experiment with OOP, especially inheritance, and appreciating the importance of the OOP structure. After I did so, I realized that OOP made creating large projects a lot easier. I would suggest playing around with encapsulation and inheritance to deepen understanding.</p>
